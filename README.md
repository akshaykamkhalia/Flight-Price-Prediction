# Flight Fare Prediction: 

built a model which can predict flight prices with help of machine learning backed by data analysis 


dataset avilable on kaggle (csv)


data cleaning and wrangling done on pandas


visualizations done using matplotlib and seaborn


(advanced visualization) for creating this project done on Power BI



sklearn used for machine learning 



model based on random forest regression after analysing various other algorithms and comparing their scores and errors 






This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.



The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, 



run this command in the project directory after [cloning] 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
